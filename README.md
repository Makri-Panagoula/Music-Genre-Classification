# Music Genre Classification
 In this notebook, we attempt to classify music signals for which we have two representations ; MFCCs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) and mel-spectograms using neural networks in Pytorch.We start with a simple Feed Forward Neural Network and then proceed to a Convolutional one experimenting on optimizers,activation functions, learning rate schedulers,pooling and padding and batch normalization.
