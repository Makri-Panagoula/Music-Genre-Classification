# Music Genre Classification
 In this notebook, we attempt to classify music signals for which we have two representations ; MFCCs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) and mel-spectograms using neural networks in Pytorch.We start with a FNN and then proceed to a CNN experimenting on optimizers,activation functions, learning rate schedulers,pooling and padding and batch normalization.

 # Face Recognition
 In this notebook we implement the Eigenfaces method (combination of PCA for feature extraction and nearest neighbour classifier for face recognition).We utilize images from the Yale B database. We conduct experiments involving varying the number of components and explore other methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Subsequently, we provide theoretical documentation of the outcomes.
